# wispy: WIll's Super PYthon utilities

This Python package contains Python functions that I've needed to use commonly.
It is broken in to several different modules:

* `wispy.percolator` contains functions for working with Percolator
  tab-delimited files in Python.
  
* `wispy.themes` contains functions to set matplotlib/seaborn themes for my
  figures, e.g. for papers and posters.
  
* `wispy.plot` contains plotting utility functions, such as adding a y=x line to
  a plot.
  
There is currently no separate documentation, but all function are annotated
with clear docstrings. 

## Installation  
**wispy** requires Python 3.6+ and can be installed directly from GitHub using pip:

```
pip install git@github.com:wfondrie/wispy.git
```
